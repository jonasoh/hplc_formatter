# HPLC Reformatter

This is a simple Shiny app which reformats **Compund Summary** report files (usually named *GLPrprt.txt*) into a more usable wide format, with one line per sample. This facilitates data analysis, including plotting in Excel. The app was developed for internal use and may or may not suit your needs.
